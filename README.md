## How to use
1. run exe
2. select a (png) template image (the template image is an image that the application will look for, try to provide an image that is present in every screen you want to be saved)
3. select a (mp4) brawl vod
4. you will see the accuracies in the console view. if you don't get a match (0.90+) in the first minute your template image is probably bad. For me it works to open the video in vscode, and take a `WIN + S` screenshot, and save it as png.
